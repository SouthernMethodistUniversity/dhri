<p>We have been discussing different aspects and stages of digital scholarship projects.When you are looking to start a digital research project, you will need access to data. That access can be complicated by a number of issues including: legal, technical, logistical, ethical, etc.</p>
<p>In this session we will be discussing those issues that can effect access such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In accessing or creating data sets, there can be legal (copyright, licensing), technical/logistical (institutional) or ethical issues.</p></li>
<li><p>We will be discussing:</p>

<li><p>The related topics of ethics, consent and power in the creation or repurposing of already existing data sets.</p></li>

<h1>Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>The approach of this discussion is premised on the understanding that there is no simple roadmap for practicing ‘good ethics’ and, indeed, what constitutes ‘good’ or ‘ethical’ for one individual may vary from the next and is often reflective of a scholar’s political commitments and personal background.  Nonetheless, we will foreground key ethical questions to ask (and keep asking!) when designing and doing digital projects or digital research, and key concepts to draw upon when thinking through these questions.</p>
<p>We will discuss:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Specific ethical questions and levels of impact to consider when doing various forms of digital research and using digital tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="what-are-ethics">
<h2>What are ethics?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of this session, we define ethics as the moral principles that an individual aims to follow in practice to the best of their ability, research, and foresight.</p>
<p>Ethics are not just a list of universal standards that can be found in a research methods textbook, or the entirety of the Institutional Review Board’s protocols, or that which is legal under the current political regime where one is located. Ethics are about being caring and sensitive towards the ways in which what an individual does and does not do affects other people, foremost, and perhaps also ecosystems, and trying one’s best to not only not cause harm to them but ideally also actively do good (or even take an activist approach!).</p>
<p>Practicing good ethics is in part acting on one’s moral instincts, but it is also about stopping to question those instincts, to research histories and effects, and to empathize and communicate with individuals and communities.</p>

<section id="situated-ethics">
<h3>Situated ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#situated-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Situated ethics</strong> refers to the notion that a person’s understandings of and commitments to ethics or morality are greatly linked to their own experiences, positionalities, and political orientations, as well as the particular context in which that person is putting such ethics into practice (see Helen Simons and Robin Usher, <em>Situated Ethics in Educational Research</em>, 2000). “Situated ethics” draws on Donna Haraway’s concept of <em>Situated Knowledges</em> (1988), which argues that all ideas, whether in science, the humanities, or personal convictions, are created from and are inherently representative of the conceptualizer’s particular situated standpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“I would like to insist on the embodied nature of all vision, and so reclaim the sensory system that has been used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere. This is the gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation. This gaze signifies the unmarked positions of Man and White, one of the many nasty tones of the word objectivity to feminist ears in scientific and technological, late industrial, militarized, racist and male dominant societies, that is, here, in the belly of the monster, in the United States in the late 1980s. I would like a doctrine of embodied objectivity  that accommodates paradoxical and critical feminist science projects: feminist objectivity means quite simply situated knowledges.” (Donna Haraway, <em>Situated Knowledges,</em> 1988, page 581)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Situated ethics thus argues that ethical concerns will vary amongst people, disciplines, projects, tools, and contexts depending on the particular situated perspective of that person, group, or project.</p>
<p>Thinking through how ethical ideas and practices, or lack thereof, are situated may prompt questions such as: How were computers developed? By whom? Where? Why? As Meredith Broussard argues in <em>Artificial Unintelligence</em> (2018), a “particular strain of white, male bias,” to which I’d add United States and Euro-centric, runs deep in tech (page 79).</p>

<p>We are scholars, so first things first: Understand any institutional compliance requirements you may need to fulfill to be permitted to do your project or research. Note that this section is primarily focused on institutional compliance in the United States, and it emphasizes the perspective of social science researchers, who most frequently contend with Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). While humanities researchers often do not have to engage with IRB when working within their discipline, these considerations may also become relevant when creating certain kinds of digital projects.</p>

<h3>Thinking in terms of “levels of impact”<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-in-terms-of-levels-of-impact" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>An “impact approach” foregrounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“… the possible or probable impact, rather than the prevention of impact in the first place. It acknowledges that we change the world as we conduct even the smallest of scientific studies, and therefore, we must take some personal responsibility for our methods.” <a class="reference external" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yJVjdVUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">A.

<p>Let’s focus on these levels of impact:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Direct impacts on people through data collection;</p></li>
<li><p>Ramifications of (re)producing categories: i.e. the politics of knowledge production and categorization;</p></li>
<li><p>social, political, and economic impacts of projects or research. Critically consider questions of: accessibility and openness, for people of varying (dis)abilities, and depending on people’s language fluencies, access to technology and speedy internet, and geo-political location in the world.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Human subjects”:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The definition of ‘human subject’ has become, unfortunately, a litmus test for whether or not one needs to undergo ethical review before conducting research… ‘human subject’ has never been a good fit for describing many internet-based research environments… when considered outside a regulatory framework, <strong>the concept of ‘human subject’ may not be as relevant as other terms such as harm, vulnerability, personally identifiable information, and so forth.</strong>”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Public vs. private:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Individual and cultural definitions and expectations of privacy are ambiguous, contested, and changing. People may operate in public spaces but maintain strong perceptions or expectations of privacy. Or, they may acknowledge that the substance of their communication is public, but that the specific context in which it appears implies restrictions on how that information is — or ought to be — used by other parties. <strong>Data aggregators or search tools make information accessible to a wider public than what might have been originally intended.</strong>”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data (text) vs. persons:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Is an avatar a person? Is one’s digital information an extension of the self? … Can we assume a person is wholly removed from large data pools? … there is considerable evidence that even ‘anonymised’ datasets that contain enough personal information can result in individuals being identifiable … <strong>Does the connection between one’s online data and his or her physical person enable psychological, economic, or physical, harm?</strong> One way of evaluating the extent to which these ethical dilemmas may be hidden is to focus on the way that procedures for data collection or analysis extract data from lived experience.”</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How are knowledge and power mutually constituted, according to the theorizations of Gramsci, Hall, Foucault, or others, perhaps from your own discipline?</p></li>
<li><p>How might we apply the concepts below when thinking through ethics for digital research and projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some key concepts:</p>
<p><strong>Hegemony</strong> (Antonio Gramsci)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The ability of a dominant group to create [majority] consent and agreement [around a particular system of meanings] within a population without the use or threat of force” (Kenneth Guest, <em>Cultural Anthropology: A Toolkit for a Global Age</em>, 2014, page 52)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Discourse</strong> (Michel Foucault)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discourses are competing ideologies (or individualized groups of statements), constructed by people and institutions in power over time, that become dominant amongst societies of people. Discourses produce knowledge in mediums that a society perceives as normative and generally does not question; in doing so, discourses pervasively shape how the people in that society think, act, and react (see Michel Foucault, <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language</em>, 1969).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“Policing the crisis”</strong> (Stuart Hall)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Policing the crisis” refers to the unnatural process by which certain actions (by certain people) become and continue to be understood, reported, policed, and sanctioned as a type of “crime.” The police, the judicial system, and mainstream media “are actively and continuously part of [this] whole process” (Stuart Hall et al., <em>Policing the Crisis</em>, 2013 [1978], page 54). Hall et al. focus on the emergence of “mugging” and its attendant social panic in Britain, beginning in the early 1970s.</p></li>

<section id="an-example">
<h3>An example:<a class="headerlink" href="#an-example" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The hegemonic racial discourses that associate Blackness with criminality in the United States serve to justify police brutality towards and higher rates of criminalization and mass incarceration of Black people — and these higher rates of policing and incarcerating serve to justify the assumption of their criminality.</p>
<p>So then when, for example, someone attempts to make an algorithm to identify potential criminals that is produced through machine learning on “crime” data (e.g. the number of arrests or convictions in relation to demographic data) that algorithm will reproduce the racist ideologies and practices that lead to the policing and incarcerating of Black people at a much higher rate.</p>

<p>Categories are key to digital tools in many ways: the classification systems used by libraries and archives, the tags used on websites, the methods of categorization informing algorithms, and the spatial divisions on a map. The production and reproduction of these categories shapes how things/people/places, etc., are identified and grouped together, and also what is searchable, findable, and foregrounded.</p>

<h2>Bias in, bias out: Systems of oppression and inputting human bias<a class="headerlink" href="#bias-in-bias-out-systems-of-oppression-and-inputting-human-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Human beings</strong> are making decisions that inform how these groupings are being made, and human “beliefs are embedded in the design and concept of technological systems” (Broussard, 2018, page 67). Technology is not unbiased, but rather will inevitably represent the decisions of its human creators who each create from their own situated standpoints — personally, socially, and historically.</p>
<p>The United States, for example, is a society shaped by dominant systems of oppression such as <em>white supremacy</em>, <em>settler colonialism</em>, and <em>cis-hetero-patriarchy</em> (see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/access/blob/master/sections/continue.md#glossary">Glossary</a> for definitions). These oppressive systems affect — sometimes intentionally, sometimes not — the decisions people make when they create digital platforms or tools (or anything for that matter!) and the parameters of what is permitted/supported/funded to be created and shared, and thus also shape the output that results from these digital platforms or tools or their computations.</p>

<div><p>“Writing a presentation on library cataloging and classification &amp; realizing that there is nothing serendipitous about serendipitous browsing. As with everything else, someone <em>decided</em> where the book you found on the shelf would land.

<div><p>“Human beings are developing the digital platforms we use, and as I present evidence of the recklessness and lack of regard that is often shown to women and people of color in some of the output of these systems, it will become increasingly difficult for technology companies to separate their systematic and inequitable employment practices, and the far-right ideological bents of some of their employees, from the products they make for the public.” (Safiya Umoja Noble, <em>Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism</em>, 2018, page 2; see also Meredith Broussard, <em>Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World</em>, chapter six, 2018)</p>

<p>In the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science, the phrase <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/source-institute/with-ai-and-data-its-junk-in-junk-out-18b33e8f391e">“junk in, junk out”</a> (Eric David Halsey, 2017), is used to describe the the fact that predictive models take into account the data that is provided to them by their human creators, and then extrapolate to possible futures. Often this data is incomplete, faulty, or messy in a way in which the results are considered “junk,” because the data input to the model was “junk.”</p>
<p>While decisions made by algorithms are often presented as free of the personal value judgments that a loan officer or judge might apply to loan candidates or in determining the length of a prisoner’s sentence, for example, they can still reproduce the bias evident in the data the algorithm is trained on. Many scholars and activists have also critiqued the use of existing data on policing, arrests, and recidivism in algorithms that try to predict future criminal behavior. Because the data being input to the model is based on past policing practices that include the over-policing of communities of color and low-income people, that data is biased against those groups and thus will reproduce the existing bias in its predictions of future activities. For a deeper dive, you can read more in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/3/10895804/st-louis-police-hunchlab-predictive-policing-marshall-project">this article</a> (Maurice Chammah, 2016) that shows how predictive policing is <em>not</em> value-free and unbiased.</p>

<div><p>[Even more so now] “In a post 9/11 world, the U.

<p>These are <em>big</em> questions.</p>
<p>A researcher should not be expected to have all the answers or predict the future. The aim here is to thoughtfully consider these questions, to think critically about potential positive and negative effects of research and projects, and to be responsible and accountable.</p>
<p>As Annette Markham reminds us, as discussed earlier in this session:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“an impact approach is targeted toward the possible or probable impact, rather than the prevention of impact in the first place.

She points to the emergent mechanisms within cybersecurity as a particular success: using ‘red teams’ with many different specialisms to identify and address problems. Second, having a process for critical conversations to take place is key. This can be in the format of an ombudsman office whose function is to independently represent the interests of various stakeholders, a review board, or an open-door/town hall policy.

<p>In this section, we will continue to use the term “accessibility,” rather than universal design, given that it is quite difficult to make anything truly universally accessible across differences of, for example, institutional access, location, wealth, nationality, language abilities, mental and physical abilities, etc.</p>

<h3>Openness and accessibility<a class="headerlink" href="#openness-and-accessibility" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Questions to consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is your project behind a paywall? Or only accessible through propriety software or specific expensive hardware (e.g., Mac computers)?</p></li>
<li><p>If your project exists online, does it require large bandwidth to open?</p></li>
<li><p>Is your project open access? Open source?</p></li>
<li><p>Is your project licensed for sharing through <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Would you consider creating an Open Educational Resource (OER)?</p></li>
<li><p>Would you consider making any data related to your project publicly accessible? (And would this raise any anonymity, confidentiality or other ethical concerns?)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A note on “free software” and user control from Richard Stallman:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“According to Stallman, for software to qualify as free it must provide what he describes as ‘four essential freedoms’. ‘Freedom zero is to run the program however you wish, for whatever purpose you have. Freedom one is the freedom to study and change the source code’ … These two freedoms allows users to individually control their own copies of software, and tailor it to their needs, however … ‘Collective control is the way that non-programmers can participate deciding what the program can do,’ he explains. ‘It requires two more freedoms: freedom two is to make exact unmodified copies and give or sell them to others when you wish. And freedom three is to make copies of your modified versions and give or sell them to others when you wish. So when the program carries these four freedoms, the users control it, it respects their freedom, that’s free software. But if one of these freedoms is missing or incomplete, then the program controls the users and the proprietor controls the program’” (<a class="reference external" href="http://magazine.factor-tech.com/factor_winter_2017/richard_stallman_and_the_vanishing_state_of_privacy">Factor, interview with Richard Stallman, “The Vanishing State of Privacy,” 2017</a>)</p>

<h2>What or when <em>not</em> to make things accessible<a class="headerlink" href="#what-or-when-not-to-make-things-accessible" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Thinking of accessibility here in terms of making tools, projects, writing, or data readily available for re-use without having to first directly request permission, when might researchers or makers <em>not</em> want to make their work or data fully open and accessible?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“I have increasingly come to wonder if “permission-less-ness” as many in “open” movements have theorized this, is built on some unexamined exploitation and extraction of labor – on invisible work, on unvalued work. Whose digital utopia does “openness” represent?” (<a class="reference external" href="http://hackeducation.com/2018/05/04/cuny-labor-open">Audrey Watters, “Invisible Labor and Digital Utopias,” 2018</a>)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Guard against the re-identification of your data. Practice ethical data sharing.” (<a class="reference external" href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005399">Matthew Zook et al, “Ten simple rules for responsible big data research,” 2017 (rules 3 and 4)</a>)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When might researchers or makers decide <em>not</em> to even record data or media, or to delete?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Just because we can record everything doesn’t mean that we as scholars must or should record everything… At some level, all forms of recording (writing, audio, video, photo) must be evaluated for how they distribute burdens of risk and objectification.” (<a class="reference external" href="http://parameters.ssrc.org/2018/04/interview-sound-recording-oral-positionality-and-audio-as-ethnographic-object/">Roshanak Kheshti, interviewed by Kelsey Chatlosh, “Interview: Sound recording, oral positionality, and audio as ethnographic object,” 2018</a>)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“As we celebrate enhancements to the discovery of and access to our online oral history collections, we need to carefully reflect on and consider the consequences of providing immediate and widespread access to oral history interviews… No matter what the topic, oral history interviews can contain a massive amount of personal information posing a wide range of potential risks to the narrator, but also to the archive.” (<a class="reference external" href="http://ohda.matrix.msu.edu/2015/03/informed-accessioning-questions-to-ask-after-the-interview/">Doug Boyd, “Informed Accessioning: Questions to Ask After the Interview,” 2015</a>)</p>

<h2>Reflection prompt<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. If you had to describe your project to someone unfamiliar with your research, could you discuss the following questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Who will be able to access your research or project?</p></li>
<li><p>Where and through what media will it be accessible?</p></li>
<li><p>Will it cost money to access?</p></li>
<li><p>Will it be accessible in different languages?</p></li>
<li><p>Will it be accessible to people with visual, hearing, mobility, or other physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities?</p></li>
