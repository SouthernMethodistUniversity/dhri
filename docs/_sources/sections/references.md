## Math for humanists 
"This book is a primer for developing the skills to enable humanist scholars to address complicated technical material with confidence. This book, to put it plainly, is concerned with the things that the author of a technical article knows, but isn’t saying. Like any field, mathematics operates under a regime of shared assumptions, and it is our purpose to elucidate some of those assumptions for the newcomer." - [Six Septembers: Mathematics for the Humanist](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/zeabook/55/)
